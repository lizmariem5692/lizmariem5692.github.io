            <h1 class="Movie Webpage Project">Example Project</h1>
            <p>My goal for my project was to try my best to learn more about css and html coding togther, although I already know a bit of css sometimes some of the codes that need to acompany html need to be accurate. 
            I also wanted to try my best to do what I know even though I believe my partner is way better at coding then me.</p>
           
            <p> My partner Essie and me decided to do our moive webpage based on rom-coms because we both really like love stories.We also wanted it to be a horror movie for halloween.Our story is based on a woman named Emilia who just moved into town 
              and a man Sam who was acussed of murder.Emilia has fallen in love with this so-called murderer.Will this bloom a love story or a messy murder case? We both came up with the story and the fonts,images,and plot. We wanted to
              assure ourselfs that we agreed on what we wanted the story to be in order to receive a good grade. </p>

            <p> A challenge we faced was trying to get the background of our project a certain color or a background that came from a certain image.What I mean by a certain image is that we tryed to look for a spooky vampire theme so we went on google and 
            tried to get it on the code but it didn't work so we just put a color and gave all of the H1 and p a boarder.Through this project I learned how important it is to give ideas and learn from them.I learned a lot from Essie because she is an awsome coder 
            I also tried to do by best to put something new on the table.I didn't want to seem like I didn't want to help or do anything but Essie showed me alot, I migth have learned more from her then she did from me.I also learned how important communication
            is because that is the only way you can understand your partner so you can come up with ideas.I am very greatful that me and Essie had similar taste in what we wanted for our project.This made the project more understanding and fun.What I learned from this
            project I will value to help me continue coding to my best. </p>
